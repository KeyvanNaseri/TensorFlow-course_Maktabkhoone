One of the evaluation criteria in classification is the f-beta criterion (refer to the f-beta section of the opposite link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-score).

Define this criterion yourself in TensorFlow.

Build a model with 3 hidden layers and 50 neurons in each layer to predict classes in the CIFAR10 dataset 
and display the value of this criterion on the train and validation data for each epoch
