Download the used car dataset by referring to the link (https://www.kaggle.com/hellbuoy/car-price-prediction). Given that the csv files are separate, paste them together into a dataframe in Python.

In this data, its purpose is to predict the price column according to the characteristics of the cars, such as mileage, automatic or manual, engine fuel, etc., which are data columns.

Build a model with three hidden layers and 50 neurons in each layer to predict the price based on the features in the data.

Define a new loss that has three different values (l1, l2, and l3) based on the difference between the actual value of y_ture and the predicted value of y_pred.

Determine the values of l1, l2, l3, e1, and e2 and justify your choice. Compare the performance of this loss for 50 epochs with mean_absolute_error and mean_squared_error losses and draw a graph for train and validation data. Which one performs better?
